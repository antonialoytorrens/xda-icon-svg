# Draft XDA Icon

* To create your custom icon from an svg file, go here: https://github.com/mlwilkerson/fa-custom-icon-demo#to-make-your-own-follow-the-pattern
* In my case, I used **Inkscape** to create my custom icon. I used an imported png file when working on Inkscape. Then, export as *Simple SVG file*.
